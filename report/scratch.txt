While Glimpse supports basic visual effects using OpenGL shaders, more complicated data analysis is better suited for NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture\cite{cuda-zone} which exposes GPU hardware for general purpose computation.

        // once offset is under 32 (and thus all threads involved in the
        // reduction fit within a single warp) the __syncthreads()
        // calls are no longer necessary and we can save time by manually
        // unrolling the remainder of the loop
