\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

This project uses NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture\cite{cuda-zone} (CUDA) to calculate histograms for subsections of a large heat map in real time and displays the results using Glimpse visualization tools (see Section \ref{glimpse}). Profiling and optimizing CUDA applications is difficult because computations are run on hundreds of cores simultaneously. Determining and fixing performance bottlenecks is complicated by multiple interdependent concerns including: fitting kernel register and shared memory usage into available hardware, significant differences in efficient memory access patterns for different memory spaces (global, constant, and shared memory), managing synchronization of hundreds of GPU threads, and generally tight coupling of low-level hardware considerations to algorithm design. Thus, this project also discusses utilization of NVIDIA's Visual Profiler\cite{nvidia-visual-profiler}.

The input data to the histogram calculation is a matrix of floating point data values. The output is an array of integers containing the number of matrix values which fall within a set of discrete bins. The matrix data is stored in video memory on graphics card as a two dimensional OpenGL texture. This allows the CUDA histogram calculation kernel to take advantage of specialized caching hardware on the graphics card to speed data access. See Figure \ref{histogram1} in Section \ref{visualization} for a visualization and link to a video of the final application.

\section{Glimpse}\label{glimpse}

Glimpse (\url{http://metsci.github.com/glimpse/}) is a Java library for building 2D data visualization applications which take advantage of GPU hardware, allowing users to rapidly explore large data sets\footnote{I have developed Glimpse as part of my professional work over the past year. The development of the graphics library itself is not part of the scope of this project, only the development, profiling, and debugging of the CUDA histogram calculation kernel and the use of Glimpse to visualize the results. Glimpse is released under the open source BSD license.}. For example, Glimpse uses OpenGL Shader Language (GLSL) to dynamically adjust the color scale of 2D heat map plots like Figure \ref{heatmap}. The underlying data for both the heat map and color scale are stored in OpenGL textures, which allows utilization of the GPU texture cache to speed data lookups. Fortuitously, this also means that texture data displayed by Glimpse is already in video memory and accessible to CUDA kernels like the histogram calculation kernels developed for this project.

\section{Single Threaded Baseline}\label{baseline}

A simple \emph{C} program which calculates histogram bins on a single thread on the CPU was used to establish a performance baseline. The histogram calculation is provided in Listing \ref{singlehist1} and the full text of the program is available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/ulmangt/cs706project/blob/master/src/main/c/histogram_test_nocuda.c}.

The total execution time on an Intel Core i7-980X 3.33\emph{GHz} processor was approximately 20 milliseconds for a 1000 row by 1000 column matrix. GPU profiling was performed with a GeForceGTX 480 with 1535\emph{MB} of global memory, 15 multiprocessors (each with 32 cores for a total of 480 cores), and a 1.40\emph{GHz} clock speed\cite{geforce480}.

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Single Threaded Histogram Calculation},label={singlehist1}]
  for ( i = 0 ; i < width * height ; i++ )
  {
    // retrieve a data value
    float data = imageData[i];

    // calculate histogram bin index for the data value
    float fbinIndex = floor( ( data - minZ ) / stepZ );
    int binIndex = (int) clamp( fbinIndex, 0, numBins-1 );

    // increment the histogram bin
    bins[binIndex] += 1;
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\section{Approach One}\label{approach1}

CUDA developers write \emph{kernels} which define the behavior of a single logical GPU thread. Threads are grouped into logical \emph{blocks} within which they can share memory and synchronize with one another. They are physically executed on GPU multiprocessors which execute the same instruction on a \emph{warp} of 32 threads simultaneously. Multiprocessor cores have no branch prediction or speculative execution hardware. Instead, they rely on swapping out warps which are blocked on memory access or slow operations to keep the multiprocessor busy. 

Because of this Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) data parallel programming model, often the first question which must be asked when designing a CUDA algorithm is how GPU threads will map to data. For the histogram calculation problem, the simplest approach is to simply assign one thread to each matrix/texture element. That thread will determine the appropriate bin for its data value, and increment the bin by one.

\lstset{language=C,basicstyle=\footnotesize}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={calculateHistogram1: Global Memory atomicAdd},label={kernel1}]
extern "C" __global__ void calculateHistogram1( int *bins, int nbins,
                                                float minX, float stepX,
                                                float minY, float stepY,
                                                float minZ, float maxZ )
{
  // use block and thread ids to get texture coordinates for this thread
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  // convert block/thread ids into texture coordinates
  float x = minX + stepX * i;
  float y = minY + stepY * j;

  // don't over count if texture coordinates are out of bounds
  if ( x < 1.0 && y < 1.0 )
  {
    // perform texture lookup
    float result = tex2D(texture_float_2D, x, y);

    // calculate bin index
    float stepZ = ( maxZ - minZ ) / nbins;
    float fbinIndex = floor( ( result - minZ ) / stepZ );
    int binIndex = (int) clamp( fbinIndex, 0, nbins-1 );

    // atomically add one to the bin corresponding to the data value
    atomicAdd( bins+binIndex, 1 );
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Listing \ref{kernel1} contains the kernel which implements this approach. The full code is also available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/ulmangt/cs706project/blob/master/src/main/c/histogram_test.cu}. The key line in the CUDA kernel in Listing \ref{kernel1} is the \emph{atomicAdd} call. Each thread, after calculating the bin index for the matrix value it has been assigned, must increment the histogram count array \emph{bins} by 1. However, just like incrementing a shared variable in a multi-threaded \emph{c} program, care must be taken that interleaving of machine instructions does not result in lost increments.

Fortunately, CUDA makes ensuring mutually exclusive access to shared variable easy using the \emph{atomicAdd} operation\cite{arithmetic-functions}. Unfortunately, simplistic use of \emph{atomicAdd} on a variable in \emph{global memory} causes significant performance problems for the \emph{calculateHistogram1} kernel. Figure \ref{kernel1nvvp1} displays an overview screenshot of NVIDIA Visual Profiler (NVVP) results and Figure \ref{kernel1nvvp2} highlights high-level warnings provided by the profiler.

\end{figure}


Instruction replays occur when the GPU multiprocessor must serialize instruction execution instead of executing an instruction for all 32 threads of a \emph{warp} simultaneously. This can happen for a number of reasons including divergent branches (different threads within a warp taking different sides of an \emph{if} statement), uncoalesced memory access (threads accessing non-contiguous memory locations), or atomic operations on multiple threads accessing the same memory location. The Visual Profiler indicates that 59.6\% of kernel execution time was taken up by instruction replay and the average kernel execution time was 6248$\mu$s for a 1000 by 1000 pixel element matrix.

\section{Approach Two}\label{approach2}

In addition to the instruction replays due to concurrent access of identical memory locations, \emph{calculateHistogram1} the memory being accessed by \emph{atomicAdd} was in global memory. Global GPU memory is large: on the GeForce GTX 480 there is 1.5\emph{GB} of global memory but only 48\emph{KB} of shared memory per block\cite{geforce480}. Global memory also has the advantage of being accessible by all thread blocks in a CUDA kernel, whereas shared memory is local to the threads within a single block. However, loading a value from global memory takes about 400 clock cycles, compared to only 4 clock cycles for shared memory\cite{shared-memory}.

Listing \ref{kernel2} contains a modified histogram calculation kernel which attempts to utilize faster shared memory to speed up the computation. The calculation is similar, except that each block produces its own partial histogram, which must then be combined (this step is fast, and is performed on the CPU for simplicity). However, once a block's partial histogram is built in shared memory, it must still be copied to global memory before it can be moved to the CPU. This requires use of the \emph{\_\_syncthreads()} barrier function, which ensures that all threads \emph{in a block} reach the barrier before proceeding. Without this, we might start to copy histogram bins from shared memory to global memory before all threads had finished updating the shared memory histogram bins.

The NVVP results in Figure \ref{kernel2nvvp1} indicate that the overall kernel execution time for this approach decreased to 899$\mu$s. The instruction replay overhead which caused performance problems for Listing \ref{kernel1} is gone. The \emph{atomicAdd} operation is still used, but it is now writing into memory for a sub-histogram shared by 256 other threads (the block size used), instead of a single array of global memory shared by the over 1 million threads among all 3969 blocks. This results in far less memory contention. However, the two branches where only a few threads from each block zero out the shared memory bins and copy the shared memory bins back to global memory mean that most threads simply sit idle during those steps. This is reported by the NVVP in Figure \ref{kernel2nvvp3} as high divergent branch overhead.

\section{Approach Three}\label{approach3}

The third approach considered, Listing \ref{kernel3}, eliminates the need for \emph{atomicAdd} entirely by allocating shared memory space for each thread to build its own sub-histogram. Instead of each thread looking up a single texture value, each thread builds a histogram for a small (16 by 16) section of the overall texture. The threads within each block then perform a reduction to combine their per-thread histograms into a single per-block histogram\cite{tree-reduction}. Like Listing \ref{kernel2}, the CPU performs the final step to combine the per-block histograms into a single overall histogram.

The NVVP results in Figure \ref{kernel3nvvp3} and Figure \ref{kernel3nvvp4} indicate that this is the fastest approach, taking 584$\mu$s for a 1000 by 1000 pixel element matrix. The main bottlenecks appear to be poor global memory access patterns and low utilization of available multiprocessors (reported as 18.2\% achieved occupancy in the kernel details in Figure \ref{kernel3nvvp4}). Occupany is defined as the total number of active warps divided by the maximum active warps (which is determined by the number of GPU multiprocessors). Both shared memory and thread registers are limited resources which must be shared among all warps in a block. If individual threads use too many registers or too much shared memory, then processors will sit idle\ref{occupancy}.

In the case of Listing \ref{kernel3}, NVVP reports in Figure \ref{kernel3nvvp4} that register usage is the limiting factor. Unintuitively, in such cases it can often be faster to recalculate a value every time it is needed than to calculate the value once and store it in a register. I attempted a number of adjustments to Listing \ref{kernel3} along those lines, but none ended up having a significant impact on occupancy or overall runtime.

\section{Java Visualization}\label{visualization}

After profiling the CUDA histogram calculation kernel using NVCC a simple C program, a graphical application written in Java was written to produce an interactive visualization of the histogram calculations (the main motivation for performing the histogram calculations quickly was to provide interactive feedback to users). The CUDA kernel was called from Java using JCUDA\cite{jcuda}.

Figure \ref{histogram1} shows the final application. The colors on the heat map plot correspond to data values according to the color scale on the right. The black box indicates the region of the heat map which the user has selected with their mouse. The picture-in-picture histogram plot in the lower left show a histogram of the data values contained within the selected region.

Because compiling and running the project is difficult due to the need to install the CUDA development kit and JCUDA library, a video is available on Vimeo at \url{https://vimeo.com/54574489} or in the downloads section of the project on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/ulmangt/cs706project/downloads}.
